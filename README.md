## Not That Movie

[![Deploy](https://github.com/lajanki/not_that_movie/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lajanki/not_that_movie/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

A Python Flask webapp for poorly translated movie plots. Deployed to Google App Engine.

### Data flow
Movie plots are pregenerated at regular intervals by translating existing plots from Wikipedia via 1-2
intermediary languages back to English using Google Translate. Generated plots are stored to a public Cloud Storage bucket
to be read by the frontend.

Additioanlly a poster image is generated via OpenAI's [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) model.

### Cloud Storage setup
The script `setup_gcs.sh` can be used to setup a **public** Cloud Storage bucket for storing generated plots.
It also adds a 30 day expiration lifecycle rule to allow slowly renewing generated files.

### Unit tests
Unit tests for the Python backend can be run with
```
pytest
```

### Running locally
The project can be run over localhost with Flask development server.
First start the server with
```
flask run
```
Then, to generate a set of _2_ translations, send a request with
```
curl -H "X-Appengine-Cron: 1" http://127.0.0.1:5000/_generate?batch_size=2
```
Resulting plots are stored to the _dev_ bucket.

> **NOTE**: In order to save DALL-E API tokens, this will use a template poster image instead of performing an API call. 

### Caveats
* The project uses a free library for Google Translate: [googletrans](https://github.com/ssut/py-googletrans). It is not an
official Google product and not guaranteed to be stable.
* Similarly, Wikipedia movie plot content is web scraped using the page content endpoint of the API [https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/).
This relies on certain html elements like `section > h2#Plot` being available on the page and as such may break on major changes on Wikipedia's underlying page template. 

### Adding new source movies
The base set of movies to choose for the translations is definied as text files in `data/`. These include:
 * recent popular movies
 * best selling movies in the USA
 * IMDB top 250 movies

On each translation request, a random subset of movies is selected but more weight is given to the more recent and top selling ones.

New source lists can be added here, but a weight needs to be defined in [data/weight_config.json](data/weight_config.json) in order for it to be considered for
the rotation.

Movie names need to be in the format they are in the url of the corresponding Wikipedia article, ie. for the 1991 Disney _Beauty and the Beast_ use `Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1991_film)` as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1991_film)

### Deploy to App Engine
A GitHub Actions workflow deploys the project to App Engine on push to the main branch. Only the web service component is deployed. Scheduling should
be deployed manually as App Engine does not support updating scheduling only for a single service.
